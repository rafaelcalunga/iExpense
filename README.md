#  iExpense

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Present and dismiss a second screen of data.
- Delete rows from a list
- Save and load user data

This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
