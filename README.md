#  iExpense

Using this app, you can control your expenses

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Present and dismiss a second screen of data.
- Delete rows from a list
- Work with Identifiable items in SwiftUI
- Save and load user data using UserDefaults
- Share an observed object with a new view

This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
